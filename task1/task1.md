# Task 1: Networks

## Outline

In this task, we try to explore how the Internet works. There are a few subtasks that need you to write down your answer in a markdown file, while other subtasks require programming. That is to say, you'd better create a GitHub repo.

## Prerequisites & Resources 

Learn how to use Libgen for free e-books. Download the book "Computer Networks - A Top-Down Approach". Read the chapter "Application Layer" as well as the ipv4 part in the chapter "Network Layer".

## Procedure & Criteria
