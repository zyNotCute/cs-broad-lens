# Task 1: Networks

## Outline

In this task, we try to explore how the Internet works. There are a few subtasks that require programming. That is to say, you'd better create a GitHub repo. The commit messages should strictly follow the [Angular Commit Format](https://gist.github.com/brianclements/841ea7bffdb01346392c).

## Prerequisites & Resources 

- Learn how to use Libgen for free e-books. Download the book "Computer Networks - A Top-Down Approach". Read the chapter "Application Layer" as well as the ipv4 part in the chapter "Network Layer".  
- [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) (To learn a new language, I recommend skimming through the basic syntax first, then just use it! If you encounter any obstacles in your work, go back and only read what you need.)

## Procedure & Criteria

### Written Part

For the following subtasks, create a markdown file, and write your answer into it. DO NOT only give the final answer without any explanations or detailed steps.

1. What is the ip address of hust.edu.cn? (5 pts)
2. Here is a [mail message](./attachment0), what is the sender's ip address? (5 pts)

### Coding Part

1. Write a program to test whether you're in a VPN environment. (15 pts)
```bash
$ vpn-detect
True
```
(Language does not matter.)
```bash
$ python3 vpn-detect.py
False
```
