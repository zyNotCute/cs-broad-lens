# CS Broad Lens

## Outline

As the repo name says, here offers a set of labs targeting complete beginners who expect an overall glance at CS. If you follow the instructions and finish the specially-designed tasks, you may find yourself gradually stepping into the temple of computer science. 

## Purpose

I came up with the idea of setting up such labs when a classmate of mine (currently in AIA, HUST) asked me for an approach to learn CS from zero. I believe many (including me) have struggled on the path of CS as a beginner, so it might be better for me to share some resources with you.

## Philosophy

### Make it. No matter how.

The development of human productivity came from using tools. But regretfully, many traditional tutorials still ask the students to do things which others have already done. Moreover, in formal exams, we're even banned to use the Internet, which is a shared brain of human beings. That's really ridiculous in the 21st century.
Therefore, we ENCOURAGE:
- Using OpenAI ChatGPT (including the code it generated)
- Using search engines
- Using open source tools
- Using online APIs
- Copying from GitHub
- Cooperation
- Any other ways you can imagine

### Face the real obstacles. Nothing is trivial.

Some might say, building environments or writing configuration files for a specific tool is boring & time-wasting, needless to say fixing certain errors which only occur in your own OS. But I have to emphasize that only in this way can you gain the courage to face any unexpected situations and the capability to deal with completely unknown things.

## Maintainance

This repo will be updated at least once a week, usually on Sundays. Each time I will upload one task, leaving a whole week for you to finish.

## Preparation

*These steps are EXTREMELY important, don't move on without finishing them.*

- Set up a [VPN](ikuuu.eu).
- Sign up for ChatGPT. Alternatively, you can install Edge  Dev to use New Bing.
- Install [WSL]. (If you're a Linux user, just ignore) It's highly recommended to finish all the tasks in a Linux environment.

## Tasks
- [Task 0: Toolchains](./task0/task0.md)
- [Task 1: Networks](./task1/task1.md)
